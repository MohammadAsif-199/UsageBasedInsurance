# UBI

**Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) for Automobiles by using AI/ML**

**Project Description**

This project focuses on designing a usage-based insurance model that calculates premiums based on individual driving behavior and mileage. Students will develop a prototype system that collects data from vehicles using telematics devices or mobile apps. The system will analyze factors such as speed, braking patterns, and time of day to assess risk and determine insurance rates. The project will also explore the potential benefits of UBI, including reduced premiums for safe drivers, improved road safety, and lower environmental impact due to reduced driving.


**Key Features**

Telematics Data Analysis: The project leverages telematics data, including variables such as speed, braking patterns, acceleration, and geographical location, to predict driving risk.
Machine Learning Models: K-Means clustering 
Premium Calculation Simulation: Based on the predicted risk levels, the project simulates insurance premium calculations under a UBI model, showcasing the potential for personalized insurance pricing.

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
