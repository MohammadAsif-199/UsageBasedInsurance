# UBI

This project focuses on designing a usage-based insurance model that calculates premiums based on individual driving behavior and mileage. Students will develop a prototype system that collects data from vehicles using telematics devices or mobile apps. The system will analyze factors such as speed, braking patterns, and time of day to assess risk and determine insurance rates. The project will also explore the potential benefits of UBI, including reduced premiums for safe drivers, improved road safety, and lower environmental impact due to reduced driving.

**Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) for Automobiles by using AI/ML**

**Project Description**

This project explores the implementation and analysis of Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) models using telematics data. UBI is an innovative approach in the insurance industry, where insurance premiums are determined based on real-time driving behavior data collected through telematics devices. The goal of this project is to predict risky driving behaviors using machine learning models and assess their potential impact on insurance premium calculations.

**Key Features**

Telematics Data Analysis: The project leverages telematics data, including variables such as speed, braking patterns, acceleration, and geographical location, to predict driving risk.
Machine Learning Models: Two machine learning models—Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—are used to analyze the data and predict risky driving behaviors.
Premium Calculation Simulation: Based on the predicted risk levels, the project simulates insurance premium calculations under a UBI model, showcasing the potential for personalized insurance pricing.
Ethical and Regulatory Considerations: The project also addresses the ethical and regulatory challenges associated with UBI, particularly around data privacy, discrimination, and compliance with data protection regulations.

**Project Structure**

Notebooks: The main analysis and model development are contained within the Jupyter Notebook files.
Data: The telematics dataset used for analysis, which is either provided or simulated, depending on the project's scope.
Results: This section includes the results of the analysis, such as model performance metrics, feature importance, and premium calculation simulations.
