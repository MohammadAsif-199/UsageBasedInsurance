# UBI_Dashboard
This is a dissertation research project designed by JOEL MOKOLO at the university of Sunderland, M.sc Computing to Analyze Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) models using telematics data to predict driving risk and personalize insurance premiums. This project leverages machine learning to assess driver behavior and explores ethical considerations, including data privacy and discrimination in UBI implementation.

**Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) with Telematics Data Analysis**

**Project Description**

This project explores the implementation and analysis of Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) models using telematics data. UBI is an innovative approach in the insurance industry, where insurance premiums are determined based on real-time driving behavior data collected through telematics devices. The goal of this project is to predict risky driving behaviors using machine learning models and assess their potential impact on insurance premium calculations.

**Key Features**

Telematics Data Analysis: The project leverages telematics data, including variables such as speed, braking patterns, acceleration, and geographical location, to predict driving risk.
Machine Learning Models: Two machine learning models—Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—are used to analyze the data and predict risky driving behaviors.
Premium Calculation Simulation: Based on the predicted risk levels, the project simulates insurance premium calculations under a UBI model, showcasing the potential for personalized insurance pricing.
Ethical and Regulatory Considerations: The project also addresses the ethical and regulatory challenges associated with UBI, particularly around data privacy, discrimination, and compliance with data protection regulations.

**Project Structure**

Notebooks: The main analysis and model development are contained within the Jupyter Notebook files.
Data: The telematics dataset used for analysis, which is either provided or simulated, depending on the project's scope.
Results: This section includes the results of the analysis, such as model performance metrics, feature importance, and premium calculation simulations.
References: A list of references for all academic and technical resources cited in the project.
