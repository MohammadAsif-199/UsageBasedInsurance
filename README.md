# UsageBasedInsurance
This project focuses on designing a usage-based insurance model that calculates premiums based on individual driving Behavior and mileage.
We will develop a prototype system that collects data from vehicles using telematics devices or mobile apps. 
The system will analyze factors such as speed, braking patterns, and time of day to assess risk and determine insurance rates.
The project will also explore the potential benefits of UBI, including reduced premiums for safe drivers, improved road safety, and lower environmental impact due to reduced driving.
